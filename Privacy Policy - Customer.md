# Privacy Policy for InQueues

**Last Updated: November 14, 2025**

Welcome to InQueues ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use our customer-facing mobile application and services (collectively, the "Service").

This policy applies to you, the customer, who uses our Service to join and monitor queues at businesses ("Venues") that use our platform.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 1. Information We Collect

We collect information necessary to provide the Service. This includes:

#### A. Information You Provide to Us

* **Guest Information:** When you join a queue as a guest, we require your **Name** and **Phone Number**. You may optionally provide your **Email Address**. This information is used to add you to the queue and send you notifications.
* **Account Information:** If you choose to create an account, we collect your **Name**, **Email Address**, **Phone Number**, and a **Password** to create and secure your account.
* **Queue-Specific Information:** Some Venues (such as healthcare clinics) may require additional information to join their specific queue. This may include:
    * Patient Name (if different from your account)
    * Age
    * Gender
    * Reason for Visit

#### B. Information We Collect Automatically

* **Queue & Venue Data:** When you join a queue, we automatically associate your entry with the specific `venueId` and `serviceId` you are joining. If you have an account, we may also keep a record of your `visitedVenues` to make it easier for you to join queues at those locations in the future.
* **Notification Tokens:** With your permission, we collect a unique token (a Firebase Cloud Messaging or FCM token) from your device. This token is used *only* to send you push notifications about your queue status (e.g., "You're next!" or "You're called!") even when the app is not open.
* **Device and Usage Information:** We may collect basic technical information, such as your IP address (to determine your country for phone number formatting), browser type, and operating system, to ensure our Service functions correctly on your device.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the sole purpose of managing your queue experience. This includes:

* **To Provide the Service:** To create your `Customer` record, place you in the queue, and generate your queue `token` (e.g., "A102").
* **To Identify You:** To display your name and token number to the Venue's staff so they can call you.
* **To Send You Notifications:**
    * Using your **Phone Number** to send critical SMS alerts when you join a queue, when you are about to be called, and when it is your turn.
    * Using your **Push Notification Token** (if permission is granted) to send similar real-time alerts to your device.
* **To Manage Your Account:** If you register, we use your information to secure your account, allow you to log in, and reset your password if needed.
* **To Improve Your Experience:** For registered users, we use your `visitedVenues` history to provide shortcuts to your "Recent Venues."

### 3. How We Share Your Information

Your privacy is critical. We only share your information in the following ways:

* **With the Venue You Are Visiting:** When you join a queue, your information (Name, Phone Number, Token, and any Queue-Specific Information you provided) is shared with that specific **Venue**. This is necessary for their staff to manage the queue and call you when it's your turn. We do not share your data with any Venue you are not actively joining.
* **With Our Service Providers:** We use third-party service providers to operate our app, specifically **Firebase** (a Google company) for our database, authentication, and notification functions. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies and are not permitted to use your personal information for any other purpose.
* **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or subpoena, or to protect our rights and safety or the rights and safety of others.

**We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third-party marketers.**

### 4. Data Security

We rely on industry-standard security measures provided by our backend partner, Firebase, to protect your information. This includes encrypting data in transit (HTTPS) and securing access to our database. While no electronic storage is 100% secure, we take all reasonable steps to protect your personal data.

---

### 5. Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Service to you and the Venue.

* **Queue Records:** Venues may have their own data retention policies. Our system is designed to automatically clear customer queue records after a set period (e.g., daily) to avoid holding your data indefinitely.
* **Account Information:** If you create an account, we retain your profile information (Name, Phone, Email) as long as your account is active.

---

### 6. Your Rights & Choices

You have control over your information:

* **Leave a Queue:** You can leave a queue at any time from the "Queue Status" screen.
* **Manage Notifications:** You can manage your preferences for SMS and Push Notifications from the "Settings" menu within the app. You can also block push notifications at any time through your browser or device settings.
* **Access & Update (Registered Users):** If you have a registered account, you can access and update your profile information (Name, Phone, Email) within the app's "Profile" section.
* **Delete Your Account:**
    * **Registered Users:** If you have a registered account, you can permanently delete your account and associated personal data by navigating to the "Account Settings" or "Profile" section within the app.
    * **Guest Users:** If you are a guest (anonymous) user, you can clear your local data and delete your anonymous user record by signing out and selecting the "Clear All Data" option.

### 7. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.
